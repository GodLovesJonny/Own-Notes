    <td width="100%"><pre>this file has been created to satisfy numerous requests for information
on targa image file formats.  the information has been taken from
appendix c of the truevision technical guide.  requests for further
information could be directed to:</pre>

           electronic photography and imaging center

    <pre>this document does not pretend to be complete, but it does pretend to
be accurate.  if you discover any finger checks or erroneous information
please let me know, ( david mcduffee, 75530,2626), and i will upload the
corrections.  thanks.</pre>
    <pre>the lack of completeness is due to the fact that the targa recognizes
over half a dozen image file formats, some of which are more widely
used than others.  i have chosen to re-key the details on only those
formats which i actually use.  again, if you want to know more about
formats not covered here, you could contact your truevision representative.</pre>
    <pre>all targa formats are identified by a data type field, which is a one
byte binary integer located in byte three of the file.  the various
file types specified by this field are as follows:</pre>
    <pre>       0  -  no image data included.
       1  -  uncompressed, color-mapped images.
       2  -  uncompressed, rgb images.
       3  -  uncompressed, black and white images.
       9  -  runlength encoded color-mapped images.
      10  -  runlength encoded rgb images.
      11  -  compressed, black and white images.
      32  -  compressed color-mapped data, using huffman, delta, and
                    runlength encoding.
      33  -  compressed color-mapped data, using huffman, delta, and
                    runlength encoding.  4-pass quadtree-type process.</pre>
    <pre>this document will describe only four formats: 1, 2, 9, and 10.
