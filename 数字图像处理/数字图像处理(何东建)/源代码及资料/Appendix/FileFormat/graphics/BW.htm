    bw - black and white image file format and utilities<br>
    <br>
    format<br>
    a bw file contains sequences of pixels. each pixel is<br>
    stored as one unsigned char, and thus ranges in intensity<br>
    from 0 (black) to 255 (white). the first pixel in a bw file<br>
    is the lower left corner of the image. the pixels proceed<br>
    from left-to-right across each scanline, with scanlines<br>
    being written from the bottom to the top of the image.<br>
    <br>
    by convention, bw images are usually square, and thus their<br>
    dimensions can be determined by the file size. if this is<br>
    not the case, often only the file width need be known by a<br>
    program reading the file. history has left us with two<br>
    &quot;standard&quot; sizes, 512x512 and the &quot;hires&quot; 1024x1024. a com-<br>
    mon practice for other file sizes is to include the file<br>
    width in the filename.<br>
    <br>
    at some time in the future bw files will probably get self-<br>
    typing headers so that parameters such as their size can be<br>
    automatically determined by programs.<br>

    utilities<br>
    bw-fb display a .bw format image on a framebuffer.<br>
    fb-bw produce a .bw file from a framebuffer image.<br>
    bw-pix convert a .bw file to a color .pix file.<br>
    pix-bw convert a color .pix file to a .bw file.<br>
    bwstat gives statistics concerning a .bw file.<br>
    bwhist displays a histogram on a framebuffer.<br>
    bwmod a filter to shift and scale pixel intensities.<br>
    bwdiff yields the difference between two .bw files.<br>
    bwrect extracts an arbitrary rectangle from a .bw file.<br>
    bwcrop maps any quadrilateral in a .bw file into any rectan-<br>
    gle.<br>
    bwrot rotates, reverses, or inverts a .bw file.<br>
    bwscale scales a .bw file larger or smaller.<br>
    bwfilter a variety of 3x3 kernel filters for .bw images.<br>
    bw3-pix merges three .bw files into one .pix file.<br>
    pix-bw3 separates .pix file rgb colors into three .bw files.<br>
