# Machine Level Programming

## Intel x86 Processors
### Complex instruction set computer(CISC)
+ Many different instructions with many different formats
+ But only small subset encountered with Linux programs
+ Hard to match performance of Reduced Instruction Set Computers(RISC)
+ But Intel has done just that! In terms of speed. Less so for low power.
