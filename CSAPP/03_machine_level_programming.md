# Machine Level Programming

## Intel x86 Processors
### Complex instruction set computer(CISC)
+ Many different instructions with many different formats
+ But only small subset encountered with Linux programs
+ Hard to match performance of Reduced Instruction Set Computers(RISC)
+ But Intel has done just that! In terms of speed. Less so for low power.
### ARM: Acorn RISC Machine

## Definations
### Architecture(alse ISA:instruction set architecture)(指令集):
**The parts of a processor design that one needs to understand or write assembly/machine code.**
+ Examples: instrucion set spectification, registers.

### Microarchitecture:
**Implementation of the architecture**
+ Examples: cache sizes and core frequency.

### Code Forms:
+ Machine Code
+ Assembly Code
