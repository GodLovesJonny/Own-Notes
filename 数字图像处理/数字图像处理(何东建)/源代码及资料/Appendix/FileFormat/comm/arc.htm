    <td width="100%"><pre>the arc files are archive files created by the sea arc program. the compression
has been superceded by more recent compression programs. similar archives can
be created by the pak and pkpak programs. there have been many variations
and enhancements to the arc format though not as many as to the tiff format.</pre>
    <pre>you may have to use some (paranoid) checks to ensure that you actually are
processing an arc file, since other archivers also adopted the idea of putting
a 01ah byte at offset 0, namely the hyper archiver. to check if you have a
hyper-archive, check the next two bytes for &quot;hp&quot; or &quot;st&quot; (or look below for
&quot;hyp&quot;). also the zoo archiver also does put a 01ah at the start of the file,
see the zoo entry below.
