## Two views of linguistic structure:
+ Constituency = Phrase structure grammer = context-free grammer(CFGs)
+ Dependency structure

### Attachment ambiguities

### The rise of annotated data: Universial Dependencies treebanks
Starting off building a treebank seems a lot slower and less useful than building a grammer    
But a treebank gives us many things:    
+ Reusability of the labor
+ Broad coverage, not just a few intuitions
+ Frequencies and distributional information
+ A way to evaluate systems
