## Window Classification
Classifying single words is rarely done.   
Interesting problems like ambiguity arise in context.   
**Idea:** classify a word in its context window of neighboring words.   
+ Train softmax classifier by assigning a label to a center word and concatenating all word vectors surroundings it.   
+ Resulting vector Xwindow = x > R(5d), a colunm vector.
+ Use the same softmax classifier with cross entropy

### Updating concatenated vector
+ Short answer: Just take derivatives as before
+ Long answer: Go over steps together
